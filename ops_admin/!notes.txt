Add functionality to find duplicate PO's within certain date range

Other ideas..

Bake in the concession log stuff from other project to be added to each retailer page

Finish "Small order diary"

Rework reports (add boolean field to supplier table) and use qty alloc/qty required

Refreshable expiry report that can work with the rework report/concessions to display that stock will 
need reworking despite being fully allocated because it's past life for that retailer and not on concession

Similarly a expiry/concessions table for QA to know what/when to move stock
