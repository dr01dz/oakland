A database driven web application project I'm working on to teach myself; using some ideas I've had while at work to semi-automate and generally refine some processes in the office.

Originally in the vain hope of getting a better job out of it here but seems increasingly unlikely that it'll actually be put into production so mostly for portfolio I guess.
